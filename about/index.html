          <p>Hey! Luke here.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Idk what makes a person who they are, but it's definitely not a shiny list of all the cool and impressive stuff they've done. Because that only lets you know what they've done, but not who they r.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Anyways, here's a shiny list of all the cool and impressive stuff that's happened to me, bc the unplanned life stuff is the meat and cheese.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <ol>
              <li> Was born in Cali. I still feel the west coast waves slowly pulling me that way. Still have a pipe dream of becoming a 9-5 indie surf bro with a golden retriever.</li>
              <li>Lived in Boston (JP) for a handful of years. Our neighbor had a pig we fed blueberries. I wonder whatever happened to Kevin Bacon. The pig, that is.</li>
              <li>Grew up Connecticut. Some people have CT pride. I don’t think that’s a thing.</li>
              <li>Went to school in Vermont. Ran a lot of miles. Watched a lot of sunsets. Chased some butterflies. Studied probably too much. Made some really good friends.</li>
              <li>Moved out to WI. Big spooky life shattering moves turn less big spooky over time.</li>
              <li>Now</li>
              <li>???</li>
          </ol>
        
          <br>
