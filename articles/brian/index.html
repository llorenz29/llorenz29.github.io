          Meet 40-year old Brian.
          
          You might ask, “what’s so special about being 40 years old? Why can’t this guy be just Brian?”. In fact, 40-year old brian is now 50-something year old Brian.
          
          40-year old Brian is the nickname of one of my Dad’s best buddies from college, Brian. 
          
          As Medical students, they were on a tight budget and we're making enough to be floating cheddar around.
          
          Not 40-year old Brian
          
          
          Would go out and crush it. Whenever anyone asked along the lines of “dude, are you sure spending that much money is a good idea?”, he’d respond, “would 40-year old Brian really want 25-year old Brian to not get that ____, to not ____? Obviously not. 40-year old Brian will handle that.
          
          In fact, 40-year old brian is now 50-something year old Brian. He has indeed handled that. Things all worked out for him, and I would imagine that he doesn’t regret a single penny of it all.
          
          ___
          
          I’m heavily summarizing / probably butchering the story, 1 because I believe my Dad makes exaggerations and 2, because I probably couldn’t do the story any justice
          ___
          
          I’m heavily exaggerating (I hope), but you get the point. Face value, it doesn’t seem very practical if you’re on a tight budget to go out and buy a boat. Even beyond face value, hypodermis level?, it’s still not good advice.
          
          It’s a mindset.
          
          I would imagine 40-year old Luke to be this astute, erudite fella with a tweed jacket and a monocle or something. Actually, 40-year old Luke sounds kinda dorky. Let’s keep the tweed jacket, but make him more like an Indiana Jones. 
          
          I also imagine him to have a lot of things figured out, especially the 3 big questions 20-year old Luke hopes to have answered in the next handful of years
          Where do I want to be
          Who do I want to be around
          What do I want to be doing
          Insert existential spirals
          
          The thought experiment that is the 40-year old self that originated out of a drunken conversation of the collective brain trust of (sorry dad) seems to have a lot figured out. It started more as an excuse to blow a bunch of money and kick the can of responsibility down the road, but behind every hidden silly story are these succinct nuggets of practical clarity which pack a punch when I really think about them.
          
          Who is 40-year old Luke’s hero? 60-year old Luke? Doubt he’ll be any more eye candy, and certainly on the downhill slope of athletic performance.
          
          Is this like an asymptote situation? Or a parabola? Or like a pokemon evolution? Or like the third Mt. Joy album, that you look at and think “eh”, but over time it ages on you like fine wine and then you eventually see them play it and it all makes sense?
          
          If I were to sit on my future hypothetical porch with 40-year old Luke to chew the rag, what would we talk about?
          I’d probably compliment him on his amazing porch and amazing wife who is way cooler than him and he just does what he’s told and hopes he can stick around
          I’d ask him at what point his hair turned brown (or grey)
          I’d ask him  
          This is probably against the hypothetical guardrails of this thought experiment, but I’d ask for the winners of the next 17 super bowls, just for some disposable cash.
          
          
          I’ve always wanted to write, but always have had scary spiraling thoughts that one person would see it and think it was stupid. I have to remind myself that one person isn’t gonna think it’s stupid, everyone is going to think it’s stupid. Because it’s stupid to think about someone you know 
          
          Maybe the scariest thing isn’t someone 
          Because then what? 
          I’ve always been incredibly conscious of people’s opinions. Probably a bit too much. So what would 40 year old Luke say, if he were to sit down across from current 23 year old Luke on the hotel couch in Pearland, TX, and look over young Luke’s shoulder as he typed this sentence?
          
          What would 40-year old you say to you?
