        <h2>40 Year old brian</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="padding-top:1em; text-align: center;">Meet 40-year old Brian.</p>
        
        <img src="../../assets/thoughts/brian/brian.jpg" alt="Brian img" />

        <p>You might ask, “what’s so special about being 40 years old? Why can’t this guy be just Brian?”. In fact, 40-year old brian is now 50-something year old Brian.</p>
        <br>
        <p>40-year old Brian is the nickname of one of my Dad’s best buddies from his medical school days, uh, Brian. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I don’t know a ton about medical students, but I do know they typically operate on long hours and a tight budget. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Back in the stone ages, when my dad was in his 20s, he had a bunch of other buddies who went off to law, to finance, to computer. It;s hard to look at them and then look at you and want what they have that you don’t even though you know things will all work out. Until then, the name of the game was saving. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Not for 40-year old Brian.</p>
        <br>
        <p>He would go out and break the bank. Whenever anyone asked along the lines of “dude, are you sure spending that much money is a good idea?”, he’d respond, “would 40-year old Brian really want 25-year old Brian to be penny pinching instead of <em>livin?</em> Obviously not. 40-year old Brian will handle that.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In fact, 40-year old brian is now 50-something year old Brian. He has indeed handled that. Things all worked out for him, and I would imagine that he doesn’t regret a single penny of it all.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <p><em>I’m heavily summarizing / probably butchering the story, 1 because I believe there’s sweeping generalizations at play and 2, because I probably couldn’t do the story any justice, and 3 because I want to</em></p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>I’m heavily exaggerating (I hope), but you get the point. Face value, it doesn’t seem very practical if you’re on a tight budget to go out and buy a boat. Even beyond face value, (hypodermis level I suppose)?, it’s still not good advice.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But it is a good noggin scratcher.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I would imagine 40-year old Luke to be this taciturn, erudite fella with a tweed jacket and a monocle or something. Actually, 40-year old Luke sounds kinda dorky. Let’s keep the tweed jacket, but make him more like an Indiana Jones. With a flamethrower.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I also imagine him to have a lot of things figured out, especially the 3 big questions 20-year old Luke hopes to have answered in the next handful of years:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Where do I want to be</li>
          <li>Who do I want to be around</li>
          <li>What do I want to be doing</li>
          <li>(Insert other existential spirals)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <br>
        <p>The thought experiment that is the 40-year old self that originated out of a (probably) drunken conversation of the collective brain trust of (sorry dad) seems to have a lot figured out. It started more as an excuse to blow a bunch of money and kick the can of responsibility down the road, but behind every hidden silly story are these succinct nuggets of practical clarity which pack a punch when I really think about them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’m pretty sure delayed gratification is a myth. Sure, it’s probably good for ya and all, but when you study those extra hours for an extra 3 points on the test, it sure feels good, but no sooner have you gotten the score before it’s on to the next thing. There is no such thing as delayed or instant gratification because there’s always the next thing forward.</p>
        <br>
        <p>(I joke mostly here, but this is a solid thought experiment. as someone who probably leans into sacrificing for later rewards, it’s healthy to realize every once and a while that doing this for the rest of your life pushes off all the fun stuff until after you’ve kicked the bucket).</p>
        <br>
        <h2>We’re all going do die</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Of course, none of this would matter if we have infinite time, like Nicholas flamel or Santa Claus or Jimmy carter (seriously, is that guy gonna live forever?)</p>
        <br>
        <p>That’s like those crazy guys in the mountains who run 1000 marathons in as many days. With that much TOF (time on feet), you probably start asking the scary questions of what am I doing here, why am I here, why am I <em>here</em>, I wonder when that lady gaga track is coming out? Big questions. Because you don’t have that time to really waste, and when you’re doing something and thinking this way, there’s probably something profoundly meaningful about it. </p>
        <br>
        <p>If we were vampires, that great Isabell song that talks about sitting on a curb and how the meaning of life is <em>livin</em> hits on this. It taught me to never take sittin on a curb for <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapropism">granite</a> (pun intended).</p>
        <br>
        <p>It’s what makes life fugaciously misty eyed and tongue tied.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When you’re ripping down the coastline or watching the sun rise, a little part of you never gets jaded because those moments don’t come by often, and what is life but little, bite sized moments?</p>
        <br>
        <p>It’s not the last time, but it’s a time you won’t get back. So aren’t you happy you got it at all?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thank u Jason for keeping me on my toes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Who is 40-year old Luke’s hero? 60-year old Luke? Doubt he’ll be any more eye candy than I am now, and certainly on the downhill slope of peak athletic performance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Is this like an asymptote situation? Or a parabola? Or like a pokemon evolution? Or like the third Mt. Joy album, that you look at and think “eh”, but over time it ages on you like fine wine and then you eventually see them play it and it all makes sense?</p>
        <br>
        <p>If I were to sit on my future hypothetical porch with 40-year old Luke to shoot the breeze, what would we talk about?</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>I’d probably compliment him on his amazing porch and amazing wife who is way cooler than him and he just does what he’s told and hopes he can stick around</li>
          <li>I’d ask him at what point his hair turned brown (or grey)</li>
          <li>This is probably against the hypothetical guardrails of this thought experiment, but I’d ask for the winners of the next 17 super bowls, just for some disposable cash.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>I’d wonder about his regrets, what he felt lucky about, who his closest friends were and how they’ve changed. What made him cry, laugh, light up. I hope I wouldn’t be talking to a ghost.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think I’d leave my problems to 30-year old Luke, while he’d blame 30-year old Luke for everything that’s happened. That guy <strong>stinks</strong>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’ve always wanted to write, but always have had scary spiraling thoughts that one person would see it and think it was stupid. I have to remind myself that one person isn’t gonna think it’s stupid, everyone is going to think it’s stupid. Because it’s stupid to think that you thinking about one person who would think it’s stupid would be enough not to put something up, but it is. But 40-year old Luke would spit out his gogurt laughing, “you really cared about what xxx thought???”</p>
        <br>
        <p>So what would 40 year old Luke say, if he were to sit down across from current 23 year old Luke on the hotel bed in Pearland, TX, and look over young Luke’s shoulder as he typed this sentence?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Do you really think 40-year old Luke would care about the things he thought were a big deal when he was 23? Maybe. But he definitely wouldn’t think twice about not putting something online because he was scared people would read it and think differently of him. That’s stupid. So here goes nothing, I guess.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What would 40-year old you say to you?</p>
